PROJECT TITLE : Iris Species Classification

GOAL : To Predict the species of the iris flower.
        

DATASET :http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

WHAT I HAD DONE : The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities .In this project first I performed a exploratory data analysis on the Iris dataset which includes of data cleaning , data manipulation, data preprocessing , data visualization and after that I did the model building using different machine learning classification algorithms and then predicted the accuracy of every model . In the model prediction part I used different machine learning algorithms . In each algorithm I had included the accuracy score , training score , classification report , confusion matrix . While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset . During the model prediction I got different accuracies from different models , I got the highest accuracy of 99 % using the Random Forest Classifier, Ada Boost Classifier which is quite well for the given Iris dataset . While the other model accuracies can be increased more using the hypertuning . Some plots which I used for visualizing the dataset are Histogram , Barplot , Boxplot, Heatmap , Scatter plot , Pairplot , Jointplot etc.

Conclusion :
We got a good accuracy score of about 99 % using Random Forest Classifier and Ada Boost Classifier
